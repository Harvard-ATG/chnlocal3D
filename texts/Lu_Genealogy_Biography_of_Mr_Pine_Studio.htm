gentleman’s name was Daoqing, his courtesy name was Yizhong, and his surname was
Lu. His family had resided in Yaxi in Dongyang County of Jinhua Prefecture for
generations. He planted four or five pines in the courtyard, and strolled among
them everyday to read ancient books. Therefore he gave himself the style name
“Pine Studio”. He lost his father when he was nine years old. He stood out
distinctively among the common children. He did not need to be taught to learn all
that he was capable of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>After grew up, he
associated with other literati. He studied <u>The Book of Documents</u> and the
histories, and he understood clearly ancient and modern affairs. He knew [the
distinction between] righteousness and profit, and between what was of
fundamental and of secondary importance. Everything he did was satisfying to
others. He was born to a rich family, yet he was frugal, having no more than
one dish at a meal and no more than one color for his clothing. Whether serving
his parents or entertaining guests, he was extremely reserved. In everyday
affairs, he would not utter one word rashly nor would unless it was according
to the rules. Whether he was pleased or angry it was not immediately apparent
to others. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He seemed passive as if there
was nothing he could do. But when righteousness called for action, he was
determined and energetic, unafraid to do what was necessary, rather than being
led by popular custom. He was known for his filial piety in attending to his
mother; he attended to his uncle Mr. “Tranquil Studio” as if he was his own
father; and he treated his younger brothers with fraternal love and sincerity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;

in the township he never abused his power to collect a single coin extra. [When
there was a shortfall] he would donate his own money to cover [government] expenses.
If someone was too poor to pay his taxes, he usually paid it for him. One year
when there was a bad harvest, a thief assembled a group of followers and robbed
several hundred piculs of rice that [Mr. Pine Studio] had stored up. He put it
aside and did not ask. Later someone got the name of the thief and reported it
to him. He thanked the person and said: “Thank you for telling me the name of
the thief. However, I have a surplus and he is impoverished. He did this
because he had no other resort, and by doing so he simply exempted me from
giving relief. He kept on lending his own savings to hungry people. He would
burn the notes of those unable to repay him, after a year. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>His
brother-in-law, Li Minyi, was implicated in a crime and imprisoned. The prison
wardens asked for one hundred taels of silver. Since Li was poor and had no
resources, [Mr. Pine Studio] paid the prison warden out of his savings. After
he was released Li had nowhere to turn, [Mr. Pine Studio] again sympathized and
invited him and his family to stay with him; he supported them for several
years, letting them go only after Li could get by on his own. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>A certain Hu
Jianshan was related to someone who had committed a crime and his property had
been confiscated. The police demanded money and valuables, but there was none
to be had and so he beat [Hu] badly and [Hu] suffered greatly. [Mr. Pine
Studio] again gave his own money to [the envoy]. When later Hu Jianshan was
pardoned and came back [Mr. Pine Studio] never asked for repayment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>In the village there
was a youth of the Yen family, an orphan too poor to support himself. The prefectural
government called him up for immediate service as a clerk. [Mr. Pine Studio]
said sorrowfully: “If this youth goes and serves as a clerk, there is no
possibility that he will survive!” So he hid him in his home and helped him escape.
It cost huge amount of money, all from his own wealth. In the end Yen became a
good person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>After his two
younger brothers grew up and married, they asked him to divide [their father’s]
estate. He thus divided it up into equal portions. A few years later, the
youngest brother again wanted more of an estate from his share so he
immediately ceded it to him without being stingy. As for the hundreds of kinds
of taxes, he paid them all by himself, without involving his two younger
brothers. He was endowed by Heaven with a nature that was pure and sincere, which
when put into practice took the form of humaness and love; he was sincere in his
affection toward relatives and was more eager to save others from misfortune
than to [solve his own] hunger and thirst. Most of his deeds were like this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>Since he died in
the thirtieth year of Hongwu reign period (1397) thirty years have passed. The
township elders and those who knew the gentleman could all relate [his deeds].
He had five sons. The eldest is Yuanding, who fathered Hua and Rui. Today, Hua is
the Vice Magistrate of Ninghua County. Hui passed the civil service examination
in the same year as I. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>Once Rui visited
me and sobbingly told me of the virtuous deeds of his grandfather. Fearing that
they would pass into oblivion he asked me for a biography. I observe that when
Sima Qian composed “the Biography of Fan Kuai”<span class=MsoFootnoteReference>

he wrote at the end of the biography: “I have associated with Fan Taguang,
Kuai’s grandson so I have described [Kuai’s] deeds for him.” Without doubt Kuai’s
great and remarkable deeds should be transmitted to later generations so that
all would hear of them. However, Sima Qian described them for Taguang because
he wanted [his descendants] to preserve them for generations to come. Only a
few people in the world are capable of all the gentleman’s deeds. He came approached
“the humane men and morally superior men” of antiquity. His deeds should be
listed as instructions for the men of the township and the youth, so that they
will know what to follow, as well as for men such as Rui who want them
preserved for later generations. Thus I have recorded, in the hope that they
will not fall into the shade. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
