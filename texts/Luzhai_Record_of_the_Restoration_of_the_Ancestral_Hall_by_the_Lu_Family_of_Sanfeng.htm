bays for the main hall of the ancestral shrine for worshipping the ancestors of
the whole lineage and slightly front of it a three bay pavilion to facilitate
speedy arrangements. In front of that is the main room where the whole family can

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>In our age, the members
of the old families and eminent lineages are influenced by what they see and
hear and are trained through ritual and education. One need not worry that the
family will [disintegrate] overnight. [However,] when a lineage prospers it is
easy for [family] feelings to dissipate; when they dissipate the [members] become
estranged; when they become estranged it harms education and [the lineage] will
find it difficult to survive. As the generations pass it is easy for their
minds to become inattentive; when they become inattentive [morality] will fail;
when it fails they will abandon rituals and fight with each other. This is
generally why public order does not improve and popular customs decline. When a
true gentleman resides in one family he will establish the governance for that
one family. He will necessarily want to unite [its members] so they will not
become estranged and maintain [the lineage] so that it will not decline. The
way to do this does not require a complicated system of rules and
responsibilities. [Instead] there needs to be an exemplary model, this is the key
to leading and encouraging them. What is that model? It is such things as the
ancestral hall. Such things all originate from what is innate to the heart and from
instinctive tendencies. When we accord with what we have from Heaven to arouse our
aspirations, then those who are estranged will become close and those who are
inattentive will be stirred. Thus the emotions of filial piety and fraternity
will come forth in abundance. Requiting the root and recalling the distant
[through ancestral offerings] so that popular customs are again fortified will
not be difficult. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-family:Arial;
mso-fareast-font-family:PMingLiU;mso-fareast-language:ZH-TW'>From the Han
Dynasty (206BC-220AD) to the present, the Lu family has had a <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>source that is deep and a flow that is
far-reaching. Over several thousand years the distant ancestors and their later
descendants can be verified. They indeed have prospered and reached far! The
ancestral hall rose then fell, fell then rose again, and although this had to
do with the circumstances they faced at the time, the emotional unity of the
members and the strength of the family are tied to it. Today they are able to
improve on its layout and reestablish its former grand prospect; the order of
the generations is once again rectified after becoming repeatedly confused and
offerings are once again made after having been almost abandoned. The minds of
the members have become one, and they know what they should value. How can
these be achieved by seeking it outside the self? It is [possible] because
everyone [innately] has an attitude of filial piety and fraternity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
